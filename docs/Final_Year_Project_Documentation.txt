                                   Abstract
English language learning in developing regions faces significant challenges, including limited access to localized digital tools, lack of real-time tutor interaction, and the absence of locally adapted pronunciation support and payment methods. To address these gaps, this project proposes Fidel AI, an AI-powered English learning and online tutor system designed specifically for learners in regions such as Ethiopia.
The platform integrates artificial intelligence for personalized learning paths, grammar correction, alongside a tutor connector that facilitates live, scheduled sessions. It also incorporates local payment gateways Chapa to ensure accessibility. Developed using an Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) approach and agile methodology, the system comprises a mobile application (React Native) and a web dashboard (React/FastAPI), supported by UML modeling for system design.
Key features include personalized learning modules, batch management, community forums, and an administrative dashboard for centralized oversight. The system aims to replace unstructured learning methods with a structured, engaging, and locally relevant educational experience. While the project is currently scoped to English language learning, its modular architecture allows for future expansion into additional languages and advanced AI features.
Fidel AI represents a step toward democratizing language education through technology, offering a scalable, affordable, and effective solution for students, tutors, and educational institutions in underserved communities.




























Chapter One: Introduction
1.1 Background
English has become the most widely used language worldwide for education, business, science, and international communication. As a result, English language schools are expanding rapidly, especially in developing regions where students aim to improve their language skills for academic and professional advancement. Despite this demand, many schools still use traditional methods of teaching and lack digital platforms that support flexible and personalized learning.
In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and mobile technologies have transformed the way educational content is delivered. AI-powered learning systems can provide personalized lessons, pronunciation assistance, instant feedback, and continuous practice opportunities. Mobile learning (m-learning) enables students to access content anytime and anywhere, making education more flexible.
However, many global language-learning applications are designed primarily for Western users and do not match the unique needs of local learners. Issues such as inaccessible payment methods, Western-centric pronunciation models, limited real-time tutor interaction, and low dedication to self-study platforms like YouTube create major barriers for students in developing regions.
To address these challenges, this project proposes an AI-Powered English Learning Mobile Application with a Tutor Connector. The system allows students to learn English through AI-generated exercises while being supported by real human tutors assigned by the administrator. The platform integrates English learning packages, local payment options, AI pronunciation tools, structured content delivery, and real-time tutor communication providing a modern and practical solution for language schools.
1.2 Statement of the Problem
English language schools and learners face several real and persistent challenges in accessing effective digital learning systems. The key problems include:
1. Limited Access to Local Payment Methods
Most global language-learning applications use Western payment methods such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Pay. These options are not accessible to many local users. Students in developing regions rely more on local payment services, Chapa, HelloCash, E-Birr, Bank Transfer, etc.The lack of locally integrated payment methods prevents students from subscribing to learning packages and accessing structured digital learning.
2. Pronunciation Challenges for Local Learners
Local English learners often struggle with pronunciation due to differences between the sounds in their native language and English. International apps use native-speaker models that do not consider local accents or phonetic limitations. This makes it difficult for learners to practice speaking accurately, leading to frustration and slow progress.
3. Lack of Real-Time Tutor Connection
Although many apps offer automated lessons, they do not provide an effective system for real-time communication with tutors. Local schools depend on phone calls or informal messaging apps for communication, which results in missed messages, confusion, lack of follow-up, and no structured learning monitoring. There is no digital platform where tutors, students, and administrators can interact efficiently in real time.
4. Low Dedication When Learning Through YouTube
Many language schools try to help students by uploading lessons to YouTube. However, students easily lose focus due to unrelated video recommendations, ads, and lack of teacher follow-up. Without progress tracking, personalized learning paths, or tutor involvement, learners often become inconsistent and unmotivated. This affects learning outcomes and reduces the effectiveness of school-based online learning.
Summary of the Problem
These issues create major barriers for English learners, especially in developing countries. Existing apps do not integrate local payment options, provide locally adapted pronunciation guidance, support real-time tutor connections, or offer structured and distraction-free learning. Therefore, there is a need for an integrated solution that solves these problems and improves English learning for students.
1.3 Objectives
1.3.1 General Objective
To design and develop an AI-Enhanced English Learning Mobile Application that supports local payment systems, addresses pronunciation challenges, enables real-time tutor interaction, and provides structured English learning for language schools.
1.3.2 Specific Objectives
   * To develop a system where students can select English learning packages, preferred schedules, and pricing.
   * To integrate local payment methods suitable for the region, making subscription accessible for all students.
   * To provide an administrator dashboard for managing tutors, students, payments, schedules, and learning packages.
   * To ensure scalability of the system for future expansion to other languages and advanced features.
1.4 Methodology
‎A strong methodology provides the foundation for the successful design and implementation of the AI-Powered English Learning and Online Tutor System. Since the system includes both a mobile application and a full web platform, and integrates complex components such as AI engines, payment gateway, live teaching, student dashboards, tutor dashboards, and an admin panel the methodology must be multi-layered, systematic, and flexible.
1.4.1 Requirement Gathering Methods
Requirements gathering is the systematic process of collecting, identifying, analyzing, and documenting all the needs and expectations of users, stakeholders, and the environment in which the system will operate. It ensures that the final system fully addresses the real problems and delivers the intended solution.
‎Purpose of Requirements Gathering:-
   * Identify functional and non-functional requirements for:
   *       AI Learning modules
   *       Speaking evaluation system
   *       Payment integration
   *       Live class system
   *       User, tutor, and admin interface
   *    Analyze user needs.
   *     Study local payment systems (Chapa).
   *     Define integration needs with online teaching organizations.
   *    Define learning modules.
‎Requirements Gathering Techniques:-
 a) Interview
‎Detailed conversations with:
   * ‎English learners
   * ‎English tutors
   * ‎Institutions offering English training
‎Purpose: Understand real learning challenges, system expectations, payment preferences, and tutor needs.
‎b) Questionnaire (Survey)
‎Distributed online to many students to collect:
   * ‎Common learning gaps
   * ‎Mobile/web usage behavior
   * ‎Preferred learning style
‎c) Observation
‎Monitoring actual teaching sessions in:
   * ‎Private tutoring
   * ‎Online tutor programs
‎Purpose: Identify real problems that students face in real-life learning sessions.
‎d) Document Analysis
‎Reviewing:
   * ‎Existing language apps
   * ‎Payment platform documents
   * ‎AI language model documentation
‎Purpose: Understand features of existing systems and identify what is missing.
‎e) Literature Review
‎Studying academic and modern industry papers on:
   * ‎Grammar correction systems
   * ‎Personalized language learning
   * ‎Online tutoring platforms
This gives a scientific foundation to the system design.
‎Requirement Modeling Approach:-
‎We use Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) because:The system includes many interacting entities (Student,Tutor,Admin,AIEngine).OOAD simplifies modular design, future updates, and reuses. ‎UML diagrams make system understanding easy. UML Models used: Use Case Diagram, Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Activity Diagram, and ER Diagram.
1.4.2 Analysis and Design Methodology 
The system we followed Object-Oriented Analysis and Design(OOAD) methodology for analysis and design phases. This methodology focuses on modeling the system based on real-world entities and the interactions between them. This approach helps ensure that the system remains modular, scalable, reusable, and easy to maintain.The system is divided into key objects such as Student, Teachers, AI-Engine, Lesson and Assessment, which have specific attributes and behaviors. This approach supports reusability, encapsulation, and extensibility, allowing the system to easily evolve over time.
‎OOAD was chosen for three major reasons:
‎Modularity:- where the system is broken down into smaller, manageable components, making development and maintenance easier.
‎Real-world representation:- since the platform handles real entities which fit naturally into the OOAD approach.
‎Flexibility:- allowing developers to add new features or adjust existing functionalities without disrupting the entire system, enabling the platform to evolve based on user requirements and feedback.
‎For the analysis and design stages, several tools were used. UML modeling tools were used to prepare diagrams that provide clear and consistent documentation. In addition, Figma was used for user-interface wireframing and prototyping, which helped the team quickly test interface ideas and gather early feedback.
1.4.3 Implementation Methodology
For the development phase, we adopted the Agile methodology to ensure iterative development and quick feedback cycles. Agile allowed us to work in sprints, delivering small increments of functionality, continuously testing, and adjusting the system based on user input. This approach ensures that the final product aligns closely with user expectations and can be adapted to changes in requirements during the development process.
In addition the following tools will be used for the development and support of the platform:

Chapter Two: System Features
2.1 Existing System
Currently, English language schools rely heavily on manual processes or fragmented digital solutions:
1. Payment Gaps
Most learning applications require international payment systems that local students cannot use. Schools often collect payments manually, causing delays and errors.
2. Weak Pronunciation Support
Existing apps teach English pronunciation using Western standards. Local students struggle because these models do not match their accent or phonetic background.
3. No Real-Time Tutor Interaction
Communication between students and tutors is done through phone calls, Telegram, Messenger, or informal messages. This results in poor scheduling, missed lessons, and weak monitoring.
4. YouTube-Based Learning Is Ineffective
Schools upload lessons on YouTube, but students are easily distracted by ads and unrelated content. There is no progress tracking, no evaluation, no tutor feedback, and no structured curriculum.
5. Lack of Centralized Learning Platform
There is no unified system combining:
   * Student enrollment
   * Local payment
   * AI learning
   * Tutor assignment
   * Real-time communication
This makes the overall learning experience inefficient and inconsistent.
2.2 Proposed System
The proposed system introduces a complete English learning solution that integrates AI, tutor management, and local payment systems into one mobile application. It is designed specifically to solve the real problems faced by local English schools.
Key Features and Improvements
1. Local Payment Integration
The app will support Chapa for package subscription, which is easy and accessible.
2. Real-Time Tutor Connector
Students select packages and schedule preferences, but tutors are assigned by the admin for proper coordination. 
Tutors can:
   * View assigned students
   * Send messages
   * Give feedback
Students receive real-time communication and guidance from qualified English tutors.
3. Structured and Distraction-Free Learning
Unlike YouTube, the app offers:
   * Lesson modules
   * AI exercises
   * Vocabulary training
   * Quizzes
   * Tutor live sessions
This increases student dedication and learning outcomes.
4. Centralized Management for Schools
Admins can manage:
   * Students
   * Tutors
   * Payments
   * Packages
   * Schedules
   * Reports
All within one administrative dashboard.

1. User Registration & Onboarding
This state chart diagram models a complete authentication and role-based access control flow for the system. It illustrates how users move from the landing page through registration or login and then into role-specific dashboards (Student, Tutor, Admin).
Transitions show both new and existing user flows, including error handling, retries, routing to dashboards, and followed by logout.
Key behavioral characteristics include deterministic role-based routing, error recovery mechanisms, and consistent paths that ensure both new and returning users reach the same dashboard states. The diagram clearly separates authentication, role determination, and session management, providing a structured view of the system’s stateful behavior.
  

2. Self-Paced Learning Journey
This state chart describes a student’s end-to-end learning flow on a system.
It maps how a user moves from logging in, navigating the dashboard, selecting modules, progressing through lessons, receiving AI assistance, and completing learning activities.
Learning progression follows a structured path:
Dashboard ---> Module list ---> Module selection ---> Lessons ---> Module completion.
Modules unlock sequentially as prerequisites are completed.
AI assistance is integrated within lessons as an optional, non-disruptive loop that always returns the learner to the content.
Control flow is deterministic, with decision states governing locked vs. unlocked modules, next lesson selection, or module completion.
Overall, the model provides a scalable, hierarchical structure for guided, AI-supported learning, blending linear lesson progression with flexible navigation and real-time assistance.
  

3. Batch Enrollment Process
This state chart describes the full student batch-enrollment workflow, including batch availability checks, payment processing, and post-payment access.
It shows how a student moves from browsing batches, selecting one, confirming availability, completing payment through an external gateway, and finally gaining access to community and batch resources.
Core flow:
Browse batches ---> Select batch ---> Verify availability ---> Create enrollment ---> Initiate payment ---> Process payment ---> Success ---> Enrollment complete.
The system integrates external payment gateways, using redirects and asynchronous webhooks. It must maintain a consistent enrollment state during the payment wait period.
Key behaviors modeled include:
   * Gated access based on batch capacity and payment confirmation
   * Idempotent, safe payment retries
   * Automatic community access and resource provisioning after successful payment
   * Transactional updates ensuring enrollment and payment stay in sync
Overall, the model ensures a guided, reliable enrollment experience, robust payment handling, and strict access control.
  

4. Live Class and Attendance Flow
This state chart models the entire lifecycle of a live tutoring class from the system’s perspective.
Key phases include:
   * Tutor logs in and accesses a dashboard to view and start scheduled classes.
   * Class initialization and setting up video conferencing.
   * During the live session, two parallel activities occur: students join and attendance tracking while the tutor delivers content (lectures).
   * Attendance is automatically marked based on join times, with a configurable grace period for late arrivals.
   * Class ends with final attendance processing.
  

5. Community Interaction Flow
This state chart models a batch community interaction system that supports social learning features like post creation, commenting, replying, and reactions within a learning community.
Key features:
   * Multi-modal interaction with hierarchical content: posts ---> comments ---> replies
   * Rich media support with optional file attachments in posts
   * Asynchronous backend processing separated from UI states for smooth experience
User experience emphasizes:
   * Easy content discovery and seamless transitions between interaction modes
   * Support for varying levels of engagement from passive reading to active content creation

2.3.6 Activity Diagram
User Registration & Onboarding
This diagram illustrates the process when a user first visits the platform. It begins with the user arriving and then deciding whether they are a new or existing user. For new users, they register with their email and password, then create a user account. Depending on the role, different paths are taken:

   * Students complete their profile, set age range and proficiency, define learning goals, and then an AI learning plan is generated. Then they are shown the dashboard.
   * Tutors wait for admin approval before accessing the tutor dashboard.
   * Admins go directly to the admin dashboard.
   * Existing users simply log in and are shown the dashboard according to their role. The process ends with the user starting to use the platform.
  

Self-Paced Learning Journey

This diagram shows the steps a student takes in self-paced learning. The student logs in and views the learning dashboard, then accesses their AI learning plan. They view available modules and check if a module is unlocked. If not, they see the locked module and prerequisites. If unlocked, they enter the module and view lessons in sequence. They select a lesson and access the content. If they need clarification, they use interactive questions and answers: submit a question, get an AI response and return to the lesson. If no clarification is needed, they complete lesson exercises and mark the lesson as completed. If there are more lessons in the module, they proceed to the next lesson; otherwise, the module is completed, the next module is unlocked, and they continue learning.
  


  

Batch Enrollment Process

This diagram describes how a student enrolls in a batch. The student views available batches. They select a batch and the system checks the batch availability. If not available, end the process. If available, they enrolled. Then, initiate payment, choose a method, and process the payment. If payment fails, they can retry or cancel. If successful, the payment is recorded and a receipt is generated. Then the batch enrollment status is updated to 'enrolled', they are added to the batch community, and granted access to the batch schedule, and community.
  


  

Live Class and Attendance Flow

This diagram outlines the process of a live class. The tutor starts the session. Students join the session and the system checks if they are on time. They are marked as present, late, or absent. Present and late students participate in the class. The tutor delivers content, conducts interactive activities, practice, and holds a questions and answers session. Then the tutor ends the session. Absent students are recorded and included in the attendance update.
  


  

Community Interaction Flow
This diagram shows how users interact with the batch community. The user accesses the community and chooses an action: view posts, create a post, comment, or reply to a comment.

   * For viewing posts, they browse the feed, read posts/comments, and react (like/dislike).
   * For creating a post, they click 'New Post', write content, attach files if needed, submit, and the post appears in the feed.
   * For commenting, they select an existing post, write a comment, submit, and the comment appears threaded.
   * For replying to a comment, they select a comment, write a reply, submit, and the nested reply appears.
  





AI Interaction Flow
This diagram illustrates the AI interaction process. The user chooses between lesson-specific questions and answers or free conversation.

   * For lesson-specific questions and answers, the AI context is set to the current lesson.
   * For free conversation, the user sets a starting topic and the AI context is set to the student profile and goals.
   * Then the user asks a question. The system checks the AI cache for similar queries. If a cached response exists, it is returned; otherwise, a new LLM response is generated, stored in the cache, and returned. The answer is displayed. The user can then continue the conversation (ask follow-up) or end it. The conversation thread is saved and learning insights are updated, then the user returns to learning.

If no clarification is needed, they complete lesson exercises and mark the lesson as completed. If there are more lessons in the module, they proceed to the next lesson; otherwise, the module is completed, the next module is unlocked, and they continue learning.
  

3. Batch Enrollment Process
This diagram describes how a student enrolls in a batch. The student views available batches. They select a batch and the system checks the batch availability. If not available, end the process. If available, they enrolled. Then, initiate payment, choose a method, and process the payment. If payment fails, they can retry or cancel. If successful, the payment is recorded and a receipt is generated. Then the batch enrollment status is updated to 'enrolled', they are added to the batch community, and granted access to the batch schedule, and community.
  

4. Live Class and Attendance Flow
This diagram outlines the process of a live class. The tutor starts the session. Students join the session and the system checks if they are on time. They are marked as present, late, or absent. Present and late students participate in the class. The tutor delivers content, conducts interactive activities, practice, and holds a  questions and answers session. Then the tutor ends the session. Absent students are recorded and included in the attendance update.
  

5. Community Interaction Flow
This diagram shows how users interact with the batch community. The user accesses the community and chooses an action: view posts, create a post, comment, or reply to a comment.
   * For viewing posts, they browse the feed, read posts/comments, and react (like/dislike).
   * For creating a post, they click 'New Post', write content, attach files if needed, submit, and the post appears in the feed.
   * For commenting, they select an existing post, write a comment, submit, and the comment appears threaded.
   * For replying to a comment, they select a comment, write a reply, submit, and the nested reply appears.
  

6. AI Interaction Flow
This diagram illustrates the AI interaction process. The user chooses between lesson-specific  questions and answers or free conversation.
   * For lesson-specific  questions and answers, the AI context is set to the current lesson.
   * For free conversation, the user sets a starting topic and the AI context is set to the student profile and goals.
   * Then the user asks a question. The system checks the AI cache for similar queries. If a cached response exists, it is returned; otherwise, a new LLM response is generated, stored in the cache, and returned. The answer is displayed. The user can then continue the conversation (ask follow-up) or end it. The conversation thread is saved and learning insights are updated, then the user returns to learning.
